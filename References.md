For my project, I want to contribute to a desktop podcast manager.
Here are some projects that I am interested in working on:

VLC: http://www.videolan.org/vlc/index.html
VLC is my primary media player and podcast manager. Although it has a myriad of options
and settings for playing audio and video, it only has basic functions for podcast managing.
it uses GPLv2 for its license.

gPodder: http://gpodder.org/
gPodder is an application that is specifically for managing and listening to podcasts.
I personally have never used it before, but it has a simple interface and is not as popular as
VLC, so it might need more help in implementing new features. It uses GPLv3 for its license.

Banshee: http://banshee.fm/
Like VLC, Banshee is a media player with podcast support. It is popular among Linux users and is
included in some distros by default. It uses the MIT license
